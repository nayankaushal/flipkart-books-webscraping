# flipkart-books
Hi! I have performed Web Scraping using BeautifulSoup library to get the data of books available on Flipkart. This data is cleaned and further utilized to create visualizations to generate meaningful insights. Following is the list of components available in this project and a brief description about them:

1. flipkart-webscraping.ipynb - web scraping of data from the "Books" section of the e-commerce website Flipkart
2. flipkart_books.csv - data file extracted directly from the webpages
3. Data Cleaning Flipkart Books.ipynb - data cleaning of flipkart_books.csv is performed
4. flipkart_books_cleaned.csv - data file containing cleaned data
5. EDA Flipkart Books.ipynb - exploratory data analysis performed on the cleaned data set
6. Flipkart Analysis.twbx - tableau visualization, also available on https://public.tableau.com/views/FlipkartAnalysis_16039956748300/FlipkartBooksAnalysis?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link
